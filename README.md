# PyMosaic

A mosaic generating program (rewriting in progress)

## Planned features

* Bulk processing from a source

* Local or remote sources (will download "tileset")

* Filename ignore patterns for tileset files

* Output settings: max size (either bytes or dimensions), file format, name patterns, location
